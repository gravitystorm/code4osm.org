The OpenStreetMap project aims to distribute a global, up to date and
richly detailed map of the world. Collecting data is the first step
in doing that and is critically important.

# Primary sources

There are many forms of data available to contributors, of which the
primary and most fundamental is the real world itself. No other data
source can be as up to date or trustworthy as doing a survey
immediately before editing OpenStreetMap.

[Traditional forms of surveying](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying)
can be used and, although these typically have a very high accuracy,
they are very time consuming. Many contributors choose to use more
convenient tools for surveying, each of which has distinct advantages
for different styles of surveying and different sets of information
being collected.

## Field papers

[Field papers](http://fieldpapers.org/) is a project to make printable
maps which contributors can annotate, upload and use in their
[editing tool](editing-tools.html). This has the advantage of being
very robust, reliable and easy to understand, in addition to being
usable for a very wide variety of surveying since the annotations are
completely free form.

## Smart phone apps

There are many smart phone apps for collecting data, ranging from
ones which aid tagging a small subset of points of interest to ones
which can collect pictures, audio, log GPS and much more.

## GPS loggers

Dedicated GPS logging devices are much better suited to some types of
surveying - particularly hiking or riding trails. A dedicated device
will typically have a much longer battery life than a smart phone, and
generally better accuracy too.

GPS loggers produce output in a variety of formats, and many include
the ability to tag or annotate traces with waypoint information which
can be very useful. Software to translate between the variety of
(sometimes proprietary) formats and the GPX standard which the
OpenStreetMap [website](website.html) accepts exists, for example
[GPSbabel](http://www.gpsbabel.org/).

# Secondary sources

TODO. Things like:

* Vector background layers / merge tool in Potlatch 2.
* Aerial imagery tracing.
* Data import and clean-up / conflation tools.
