Code 4 OSM
==========

A site which brings together resources for those developing software
using OSM data, or part of the OSM infrastructure.

This is a really simple bit of Ruby software to pull together
documentation from various places and try to arrange and style it into
some sort of cohesive and useful site.

Contributing
============

If you see a problem, please [report an
issue](https://github.com/zerebubuth/code4osm.org/issues) or, even
better, fork [the
repository](https://github.com/zerebubuth/code4osm.org) and submit a
pull request for the fix.

We encourage documentation to be written and maintained as close as
possible to the source code, and within the repository of the original
project. Code4OSM imports this documentation, but aims not to
duplicate it.
